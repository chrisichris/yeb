Welcome to the yeb - a very simple yeti webframework
==============================

Better said yeb is still an experiment and very alpha. However I publish it here, just in case someone is intressting in some yeit code, does something similar, has suggestions etc.

It does not only contain a web-framework (org.yeb.mvc) but also modules for database (org.yeb.db), validation (org.yeb.validation), utilities (org.yeb.std), json (org.yeb.json) and a httpclient (org.yeb.httpclient). All of these are very alpha. However they are tested

The test-module (org.yeb.yebspec) is because of this also the most stable module and I think quite useful. You might start with this one and look at the different specs 
in the src/test/java folder. 

## Obtaining

You can of git clone it and build it with maven.

And jar is in the my maven-repo <http://chrisichris.github.com/chrisis-maven-repo/snapshots/>. 

		group-id: org.yeb
